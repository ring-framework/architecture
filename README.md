# Ring Framework ⚬ Architecture

Ring Framework architecture and decision notes

## How to use

Architecture project uses [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) for modeling.
If you haven't installed Structurizr locally, you may run it in Docker Container:

```bash
bash ./run.sh
```

Now, you may interact with diagrams from your browser — just open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/workspace/diagrams).
